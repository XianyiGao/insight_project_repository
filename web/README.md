# Web Application Source Code Directory

Simply run `./run.py` to host the web app locally using flask.

## Things you will need

Since the web app use the pre-trained machine learning model to estimate price, you need to obtain the model by using "etsy_item_price_estimation" package.

Alternatively, you can download a pre-trained machine learning model from the link:

Make sure you save the model as filename: "machine_learning_model". Then put the trained model under the "flask_etsy_app/static" folder.
